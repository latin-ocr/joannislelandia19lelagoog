De Rebus Anglicanis Opz'tstula Vah'a.

At One of the Clock in the Afternoone began the said
‘ JusteS, and the Kings Royall Majesty, with my Lord Pro· ⁹
«τεέὶοῑ, and other Noblemen, were present m his Highnes' s
Gallary to see the sarhe, which was right nobly done as
hereafter followeth.

The foresaid Challengers came against every one of these
Defenders, Six CorseS. And as many as would of the said
Defenders had two Courses every one of them befidezt, for
their Ladyes Sake. And so they pat-ted fourth that Day
with great Vallantne‘S, and so nobly behaved themselves on
either Party, that Thankes be to God, there was neither of
them nor of their Herses hurt. And they brake many Spearee
vso readyly, that ιτ wasto their great Honour. And they had

the Praises of all the People there affernbled3 as they were
well worthy of. .-

At Night they returned in goodly Order as they came to
my Lord Admir'al s House, where they had a goodiy Suppoe Ἴ

prepared for them, with great F easta and Knowledge.
